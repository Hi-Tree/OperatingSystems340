4.6)  What resources are used when a thread is created? How do they differ from those used when a process is created? 

      Answer: Because a thread is smaller than a process, thread creation typically uses fewer resources 
	than process creation. Creating a process requires allocating a process control block (PCB), a rather 
	large data structure. The PCB includes a memory map, a list of open files, and environment variables. 
      Allocating and managing the memory map is typically the most time-consuming activity. Creating either
      a user thread involves allocating a small data structure to hold a register set,
	stack, and priority.


4.13)  Is it possible to have concurrency but not parallelism? Explain. 

	 Answer: Yes. Concurrency means that more than one thread is progressing. However, it does not 
	 imply that the threads are running on CPUs simultaneously. The scheduling of tasks allows for concurrency, but
	 parallelism is supported only on systems with more than one processing core.
